## Homework
1) Using the "string" library reference (see above), do the following:
  - Write a program that gives you the number of characters (see "length") of a sentence a user inputs.
  - Write a program that asks for your name and then capitalizes all the letters.
  - Write a program that asks for a sentence and lower cases all the letters.
