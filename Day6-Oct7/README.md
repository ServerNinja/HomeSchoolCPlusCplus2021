## Class Discussion
- Review do while loops
- Go over a few new math operators
  - `++`
  - `--`
  - `+=`
- Go over problems 1 and 2
- Go over fibonacci problem
- Go over sum of even numbers problem

## Homework
1) Write a program that will print the multiplication table of a number

Example:

```
Input number between 1 and 12: 5
5 * 1 = 5
5 * 2 = 10
5 * 3 = 15
5 * 4 = 20
5 * 5 = 25
5 * 6 = 30
5 * 7 = 35
5 * 8 = 40
5 * 9 = 45
5 * 10 = 50
5 * 11 = 55
5 * 12 = 60
```

2) Write a program that will ask for a range (ie. between 1 and 10) and will output the sum of all "natural" numbers in that range. 

Example:
```
Enter lower limit: 1
Enter upper limit: 10
Sum of natural numbers 1 to 10: 55
```
