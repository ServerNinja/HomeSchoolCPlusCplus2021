## Homework
1) Finding height of tree

A forest management company is tasked with documenting every tree in a county park. One of the pieces of information they must produce is the approximate height of the tree.

To figure this out, an observer would view the tree at a distance and make the following measurements:
- The angle of the very top of the tree within viewpoint
- His own height
- The distance he stood from the tree when taking the angle measurement

The formula an observer would use to determine the hight of a tree:
```
H = (Tan(A * d)) + y
``` 
- H = height of the tree
- d = distance of the observer from the tree
- A = angle to the top of the tree
- Y = the height of the observer
- "Tan" refers to "tangent"

Please write a simple program using the cMath library (math.h) to provide inputs for an observer's measurements in order to determine the height of a tree.

Be sure your program includes the following:
- Error checking for inputs
- The use of at least one function other than "int main()"
- Showing the use of a function from the math.h library (link in resources above to library reference)
