## Class Discussion
- For loops
- Nested Loops

## Homework
1) Write a program that will print ALL multiplication tables (1-12) using nested loops

Example (keeps going until 12 * 12 = 144):

```
1 * 1 = 1
1 * 2 = 2
1 * 3 = 3
1 * 4 = 4
1 * 5 = 5
1 * 6 = 6
1 * 7 = 7
1 * 8 = 8
1 * 9 = 9
1 * 10 = 10
1 * 11 = 11
1 * 12 = 12
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
```

2) Write a for loop that prints out package labels for the number of boxes entered in...

Example:
```
Please input the number of boxes: 3

Labels...

4024 Anders Rd.
Hastings, MI 49058
Box 1 of 3

4024 Anders Rd.
Hastings, MI 49058
Box 2 of 3

4024 Anders Rd.
Hastings, MI 49058
Box 3 of 3
```

3) Write a program that will print a pattern of numbers as seen below:

Example:
```
Please input the number of rows: 5                                                                                  
1 2 3 4 5                                                                                                         
2 3 4 5                                                                                                          
3 4 5                                                                                                           
4 5                                                                                                            
5
```

4) Write a program to display a pyramid of digits as seen below:

Example
```
Please input the number of rows: 5                                           
    1                                                                  
   232                                                                 
  34543                                                                
 4567654                                                               
567898765
